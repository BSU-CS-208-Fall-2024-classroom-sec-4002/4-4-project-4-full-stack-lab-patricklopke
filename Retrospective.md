## Experience

I had a bit of trouble with this assignment. I was very confused initially about what I was supposed to
do and spent a lot of time just looking at the code and at the textbook. Eventually I realized I was
overcomplicating things and most of the code I needed was given. I was able to get my code to run although
it isn't the most efficent or best practice. I really enjoyed the css part of the assignment as I made sure to make my website very ugly hopefully I win the extra credit. Overall, this assignment was harder but I still really enjoyed it.
